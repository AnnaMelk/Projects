# Projects
Some of the cleaned code from the internships in Labs


 - Eccentricity fit.py - The data provided in pandas.Dataframe was visualized and then logistic and polynomial regression was fitted to the mean eccentricity values.  


 - Majority-Minority Model.py - Create a Watts-Strogatz small-world graph using NetworkX and then track the changes in the network with different initialization parameters: 
1. Number of nodes
2. Number of connections between nodes
3. Proportion of nodes with the same values 
4. Probability of rewiring
5. Probability of a change in the value of a node 
6. Vote update methods - synchronous and asynchronous (are all nodes updates at the same time or sequentially?)

Checking the frequency and speed with which the network reaches a desicion or a stalemate was the main goal of the project.


 - Transformations_2D_3D.py - Transformations for 2D and 3D images I couldn't make work or were not available in torchvision.transforms
